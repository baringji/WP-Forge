###WP-Forge was built with the following tools###
* [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) - A list of standards that all themes should be coded with set forth by WordPress.
* [WP-Test] (http://wptest.io/) - An exhaustive set of test data that was developed over three years to measure the integrity of themes and plugins. Developed by [Michael Novotny] (http://manovotny.com/)
* [Debug Bar] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) - a debugging menu added to the admin bar that quickly shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.
* [Log Depreceated Notices] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/) - a plugin that helps you identify old WordPress API functions a theme or plugin is currently using so you can update to the newer methods.
* [Theme Check] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) - a simple and easy way to test your theme for all the latest WordPress standards and practices.
* [Monster Widget] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/) - A widget that provides a quick and easy method of adding all core widgets to a sidebar for testing purposes.
* [Viewport Resizer] (http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/) - a handy bookmarklet that will load your site in a viewport the size of common devices. This is helpful in testing responsive design.
* [Screenfly] (http://quirktools.com/screenfly/) â€“ Responsive screen testing for monitors, tablets, smart phones, and more (personally one of my favorites).

Features
=============

###Theme Customizer###
WordPress introduced the [Theme Customizer] (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API) in 3.4. The customizer allows you to modify certain areas of a theme and preview those changes in real time before publishing. WP-Forge utilizes this built in customizer and allows you to make changes to many areas of the theme. Please read the information under Configuration in the README.txt file to learn more about the customizer in WP-Forge.

###jQuery###
WP-Forge uses the version of jQuery bundled with WordPress and it is loaded in the header. This practice falls within the [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development). You can do a search and find the information you need to use Google's version and load it in the footer if you wish.

###Child Theme###
I have created a [WordPress child theme] (http://themeawesome.com/wordpress-child-theme/) for WP-Forge called WP-Starter. If you prefer, you can also create your own child theme. You can learn how to do this over at the [WordPress Codex] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)

###Genericons 3.4.1###
Includes the free WordPress icon set [Genericons] (https://genericons.com/)

###Font-Awesome 4.7###
Includes the free icon set [Font-Awesome] (http://fontawesome.io)

###Yoast SEO Plugin###
Has built in support for breadcrumbs using the Wordpress SEO by Yoast plugin. The code is already added to all necessary files for you. Download the [WordPress SEO by Yoast] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin.
